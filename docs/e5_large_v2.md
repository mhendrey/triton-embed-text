#  E5 Large V2 Text Embeddings
This deployment hosts the [E5-large-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large-v2)
text embedding model. You provide it your text and it returns the embedding vector
(d=1024) that can be used for information retrieval or building downstream classifiers.
This is a Triton Inference Server
[ensemble](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/user_guide/architecture.html#ensemble-models)
of the [e5_large_v2_tokenizer](../model_repository/e5_large_v2_tokenizer)
(CPU) and the [e5_large_v2_model](../model_repository/e5_large_v2_model)
(GPU) deployment models.

**Note**
  * Maximum input token size is 512 tokens which is the expected size. Text longer
    than this will throw an error.
  * As specified in the Huggingface model card. You need to prefix your text with
    "query: " or "passage: " before tokenizing the text. Note the space after the colon
      * Use "query: " & "passage: " correspondingly for asymmetric tasks such as
        passage retrieval in open QA or ad-hoc information retrieval
      * Use "query:" prefix for symmetric tasks such as semantic similarity, bitext
        mining, paraphrase retrieval
      * Use "query: " prefix if you want to use embeddings as features, such as linear
        probing classification or clustering

Dynamic batching is enabled for this deployment, so clients simply send in each request
separately.

This is a lower level of abstraction, most clients likely should be using
[embed_text](embed_text.md) deployment.

## Example Request
Here's an example request. Just a few things to point out
1. "shape": [1, 1] because we have dynamic batching and the first axis is
   the batch size and the second axis the number of text strings to send (in this
   case always 1).
2. "datatype": "BYTES" because the input text is a string [don't ask why its not
   'STRING']

```
import numpy as np
import requests

base_url = "http://localhost:8000/v2/models"
text = (
    "query: The iridescent chameleon sauntered across the neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape."
)

inference_request = {
    "inputs": [
        {
            "name": "INPUT_TEXT",
            "shape": [1, 1],
            "datatype": "BYTES",
            "data": [text],
        }
    ]
}
model_response = requests.post(
    url=f"{base_url}/e5_large_v2/infer",
    json=inference_request,
).json()

"""
JSON response output looks like
{
    "model_name": "e5_large_v2",
    "model_version": "1",
    "parameters": {
        "sequence_id": 0,
        "sequence_start": False,
        "sequence_end": False,
    },
    "outputs": [
        {

            "datatype": "FP32",
            "shape": [1, 1024],
            "data": [
                0.03348,
                -0.0828,
                ...,
            ]
        }
    ]
}
"""

embedding = np.array(
    model_response["outputs"][0]["data"],
    dtype=np.float32
)
```

### Sending Many Requests
If you want to send a lot of text requests to be embedded, it's important that you send
each request in a multithreaded way to achieve optimal throughput.

NOTE: You will encounter a "OSError Too many open files" if you send a lot of requests.
Typically the default ulimit is 1024 on most system. Either increace this using 
`ulimit -n {n_files}`, or don't create too many futures before you process them when
completed.

```
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
import numpy as np

    "query: The iridescent chameleon sauntered across the neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape.",
]

            ]
        }
        future = executor.submit(requests.post,
            url=f"{base_url}/e5_large_v2/infer",
            json=inference_request,
        )
        futures[future] = i
    
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        try:
            response_json = future.result().json()
        except Exception as exc:
            print(f"{futures[future]} threw {exc}")
        else:
            if "error" not in response_json:
                data = response_json["outputs"][0]["data"]
                embedding = np.array(data, dtype=np.float32)
                embeddings[futures[future]] = embedding
            else:
                print(f"{futures[future]} threw {response_json['error']}")

print(embeddings)
```

## Performance Analysis
There is some data in [data/embed_text](../data/embed_text/e5_large_v2_text.json)
which can be used with the `perf_analyzer` CLI in the Triton Inference Server SDK
container.

```
sdk-container:/workspace perf_analyzer \
    -m e5_large_v2 \
    -v \
    --input-data data/embed_text/e5_large_v2_text.json \
    --measurement-mode=time_windows \
    --measurement-interval=20000 \
    --concurrency-range=60 \
    --latency-threshold=1000
```

## Validation
To validate that the model is performing as expected, we calculate the performance on the
[BUCC Bitext Mining dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/bucc-bitext-mining)
and compare the performance against results published in the
[Multilingual E5 Text Embeddings: A Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05672).

This dataset consists of 4 separate dataset with pairs of sentences in [zh-en, fr-en,
de-en, and ru-en]. Table 5 in the paper reports that the Multilingual E5 large model
achieved **98.6** on this benchmark. Unfortunately the paper doesn't give any details
as to how they did the evaluation. In particular, the BUCC Biitext Mining dataset is
supposed to consist of non-parallel sentences with only about 2-3% of the sentences
having a corresponding translated sentence in the other language. However, the
Huggingface test data has aligned sentences. This may make the task much too easy, but
we will proceed in the absence of more information.

For each language pair dataset, we query with one side and calculate the top-1 accuracy
of finding the corresponding pair in the other language. We calculate a weighted
average across the four sets of language pairs to get a single number. We use
approximate nearest neighbors to perform the search of the 4 nearest neighbors based
upon the cosine distance. We then perform two separate reranking methods before
choosing the top nearest neighbor from this candidate list.  The first is just the
cosine distance itself. The second is based upon a margin scoring approach that is
referenced in the technical approach. This approach is outlined in
[Margin-based Parallel Corpus Mining with Multilingual Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01136).

### Results

| Language Pairs | Margin Accuracy | Cosine Accuracy | # of Records |
| :------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------: |
| zh-en | 99.53 | 99.21 | 1,899 |
| fr-en | 99.12 | 98.72 | 9,086 |
| de-en | 99.63 | 99.54 | 9,580 |
| ru-en | 97.91 | 97.71 | 14,435|
| **Mean** | **98.79** | **98.55** | |

These match well with the reported 98.6 in the technical report.
